This is my url "shortener" for Wyncode it's url is https://cormacs-url-shortener.herokuapp.com , it takes in a url then gives you a shortkey which can be added after the /short path in the app's url like: https://cormacs-url-shortener.herokuapp.com/short/shortkey to be redirected to it's original full url. If you enter a fresh url you will be given a shortkey for it, and if you enter a url that already has a short key it will tell you it's existing short key.
